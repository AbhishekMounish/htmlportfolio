<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Monish, a web developer and an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student with a passion for technology,
   creativity, and continuous growth. I'm currently working on an innovative project—a tri-operational robotic arm controlled 
   by ECG signals,which has introduced me to the exciting world of Arduino, microcontrollers, and real-time biomedical signal 
   processing. Despite starting from scratch, I'm quickly building a solid foundation in both hardware and software integration.</p>

<p>Alongside my core studies, I’m actively learning web development and programming, aiming to create meaningful, 
  user-focused digital experiences. Whether it’s front-end design or back-end logic, I enjoy the process of building 
  functional and visually engaging websites.</p>

<p>Outside the tech world, I’m a creative soul who loves art, singing, and writing poetry. I often find inspiration in everyday
   moments and enjoy expressing my thoughts through words and visuals. I’ve also hosted morning assemblies at school, 
   which helped me develop confidence and clarity in public speaking.</p>

<p>I’m a self-driven learner who thrives on new challenges—whether academic, technical, or creative. 
  My goal is tp become financially independent and build a career that blends technology, 
  innovation, and self-expression.</p>
